# SGCHILD: A Singapore Mother Tongue Language Children Speech Dataset

Singapore is a highly multilingual society where English serves as the primary medium of communication. Mandarin, Malay, and Tamil are designated as Mother Tongue languages to preserve cultural heritage and linguistic diversity. Despite government efforts to promote bilingual education, many students face challenges in mastering their Mother Tongue due to the predominant use of English in daily life.

As language acquisition in childhood plays a crucial role in long-term linguistic proficiency, developing resources to support the teaching and learning of these languages is essential. To this end, a high-quality speech dataset of young children's speech was developed to facilitate speech evaluation tools for education and to support linguistic research on childrenâ€™s language acquisition.

This repository includes Data Collection_Reading and Data Collection_Picture Description. These resources are designed to align with the Primary 1 school curriculum.
